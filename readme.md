<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or more.

### Installation

1. Download MonTally from [here](https://github.com/ZeroxyDev/montally/releases).
2. Navigate to the settings and configure MonTally according to your preferences.
3. Open your PokéMMO or Pokémon Revolution Online game.
4. Ensure that you are using Windows 10 or a later version.

When running the installer of MonTally application, you may encounter a message indicating that the **application is not signed**. This is a common occurrence for unsigned software. Follow these steps to proceed securely:

1. Upon seeing the "application not signed" message, click on "More Info."
2. Look for the option that allows you to continue or run the application despite the lack of a digital signature.
3. Click on "Run Anyway" to initiate the application safely.

This message is a standard security caution, and by following these steps, you can confidently launch the MonTally application.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

MonTally is designed to be flexible and user-friendly. Here's a simple guide on how to use it:

1. Launch the MonTally application.

2. Access the settings to customize Pokémon detection:
   - **Automatic Mode:** MonTally will effortlessly detect and log all encountered Pokémon automatically.
   - **Manual Mode:** Users can select specific Pokémon to track, providing more control over the counting process.

3. Go to **Settings** and select **"Select Capture Area"**. Position the capture area so it encloses the region where Pokémon names appear during battles. Be sure to include enough space to account for horde battles, where multiple Pokémon names might appear on the screen.

![capturesettings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e92993e-bfeb-47e8-b46a-c998ee074cf7)

4. Ensure that the game is running, and there are no obstructions blocking Pokémon names.

5. For the best experience in games like PokeMMO, consider the following recommendation:
   - In the game settings, go to **Interface settings**.
   - Enable **"Always Show Battle HUD"** to ensure accurate Pokémon detection and logging during battles.
   - In the game settings, go to **Video settings**.
   - Disable **"Show Battle Background"** to avoid distractions that could interfere with Pokémon detection and logging.

6. Begin seamlessly counting and tracking your Pokémon encounters!

## Known Bugs

Despite its robust functionality, MonTally may encounter certain issues. Here is a list of known bugs and possible solutions:

1. **Issue:** Doesn't detect Pokémon on other screens.

   - **Solution:** Play Pokémon on the main screen to ensure accurate detection.

2. **Issue:** Incorrect Pokémon Count
   - **Description:** The MonTally application occasionally exhibits inaccurate counts, especially during initial usage. The counts may either be higher or lower than the actual number of Pokémon encountered.
   - **Solution:** Actively use the application; as more encounters are recorded, the counting accuracy tends to improve.

3. **Issue:** Unintended Pokémon Detection in Inventory.

   - **Description:** MonTally is erroneously detecting Pokémon when browsing Pokémon in the backpack or other locations.
   - **Solution:** Temporarily disable the counter in the settings during these specific moments. Alternatively, consider not placing Pokémon in the upper half of the screen.


Please note that we are continuously working to improve the application and address these issues. If you come across any additional bugs, feel free to report them so that we can continue enhancing the MonTally experience.
